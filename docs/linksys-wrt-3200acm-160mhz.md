# Linksys WRT 3200ACM 160Mhz

You have to find out the channel that in your country was setup with the router is working.
For me, I am Hungarian, but the router is FR based in FRANCE in EUROPE (or European is usually is FR), the ```100 channel``` is working.

But for now, it is using the ```radar detection``` and it is changing the channels and it works.
